# 👋 Welcome to velocity!
## ⚙️ Version 0.1

Velocity is a passion project DAW being developed by me (Cazdotsys)
This project not only serves are a passion project but simply a learning experience for me and any contributors that happen to stop by, Velocity uses a very young Rust library called Slint for its UI and more libraries to come
Disclaimer: I'm not a god-tier developer so if my contributors can be improved upon do let me know!

## ✏️ My/Our vision

Velocity isn't really meant to be seriously developed for professional use, although that would be very cool currently its simply out of scope for this project
*however* It is still meant to have advanced features you know and love while still being intuitive to use and easy-moderate to pick up (for those with previous experience)
## 🗺️ The road map
### Currently the road map is the following
* 0.1: Basic functionality for audio processing such as playing notes on a timeline
* 0.2: Basic UI development, implement features most commonly used (maybe vst support?)
* 0.3: squash any bugs that have come up, make sure the code base is clean and prepare for pre-alpha/quality assurance?
